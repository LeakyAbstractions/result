### A Java library to handle success and failure without exceptions

Wave goodbye to slow exceptions and embrace clean, efficient error handling by encapsulating operations that may succeed
or fail in a type-safe way.

- **Boost Performance**: Avoid exception overhead and benefit from faster operations.
- **Simple API**: Leverage a familiar interface for a smooth learning curve.
- **Streamlined Error Handling**: Handle failure explicitly to simplify error propagation.
- **Safe Execution**: Ensure safer and more predictable operation outcomes.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Reduce complexity to make your code easier to understand.
- **Functional Style**: Embrace elegant, functional programming paradigms.
- **Lightweight**: Keep your project slim with no extra dependencies.
- **Open Source**: Enjoy transparent, permissive Apache 2 licensing.
- **Pure Java**: Seamless compatibility from JDK8 to the latest versions.

> `Result` objects represent the outcome of an operation, removing the need to check for null. Operations that succeed
> produce results encapsulating a *success* value; operations that fail produce results with a *failure* value. Success
> and failure can be represented by whatever types make the most sense for each operation.


## Results in a Nutshell

In Java, methods that can fail typically do so by throwing exceptions. Then, exception-throwing methods are called from
inside a `try` block to handle errors in a separate `catch` block.

![Using Exceptions][USING_EXCEPTIONS]

This approach is lengthy, and that's not the only problem -- it's also very slow.

> Conventional wisdom says **exceptional logic shouldn't be used for normal program flow**. Results make us deal with
> expected error situations explicitly to enforce good practices and make our programs [run faster][BENCHMARK].

Let's now look at how the above code could be refactored if `connect()` returned a `Result` object instead of throwing
an exception.

![Using Results][USING_RESULTS]

In the example above, we used only 4 lines of code to replace the 10 that worked for the first one. But we can
effortlessly make it shorter by chaining methods. In fact, since we were returning `-1` just to signal that the
underlying operation failed, we are better off returning a `Result` object upstream. This will allow us to compose
operations on top of `getServerUptime()` just like we did with `connect()`.

![Embracing Results][EMBRACING_RESULTS]

> `Result` objects are immutable, providing thread safety without the need for synchronization. This makes them ideal
> for multi-threaded applications, ensuring predictability and eliminating side effects.

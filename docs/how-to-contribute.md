### How to Contribute <a href="how-to-contribute" id="how-to-contribute"></a>

Hi there! We’re thrilled that you’d like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

The Result Library is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) that depends on volunteer effort and built one contribution at a time by users like you. We’d love for you to get involved. Whatever your level of skill or however much time you can give, your contribution is greatly appreciated. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, helping other users by commenting on issues, or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### How to Report a Bug <a href="how-to-report-a-bug" id="how-to-report-a-bug"></a>

Think you found a bug? Please check the [list of open issues](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues) to see if your bug has already been reported. If it hasn’t please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues/new).

Here are a few tips for writing _great_ bug reports:

* Describe the specific problem.
* Include the steps to reproduce the bug, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.
* Check that you are using the latest version of the project.
* Include what version of the project you are using, as well as any relevant dependencies.
* Only include one bug per issue. If you have discovered two bugs, please file two issues.
* Even if you don’t know how to fix the bug, including a failing test may help others track it down.

### How to Suggest a Feature <a href="how-to-suggest-a-feature" id="how-to-suggest-a-feature"></a>

If you find yourself wishing for an enhancement or a feature that doesn’t exist in the library, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the current features have been added because other users saw the need.

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and goals of the project. It’s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project’s developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, including describing the problem you’re trying to solve.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues/new) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you want it, how it should work, etc.

### Your First Contribution <a href="your-first-contribution" id="your-first-contribution"></a>

We’d love for you to contribute to this project. Unsure where to begin contributing to the library? You can start by looking through [currently open issues](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smiley_cat:

### How to Propose Changes <a href="how-to-propose-changes" id="how-to-propose-changes"></a>

Here’s a few general guidelines for proposing changes:

* Please be sure to update the documentation.
* Each pull request should implement **one** feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Don’t commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix.
* Don’t bump the version number in your pull request (it will be bumped prior to release).
* Write [a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

At a high level, the [process for proposing changes](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/fork) and clone the project.
2. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `./gradlew test`.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
4. Make your changes, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
5. Make sure the changes comply with the formatting rules `./gradlew spotlessCheck`.
6. Check that the code is properly covered by the tests `./gradlew jacocoTestCoverageVerification`.
7. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/compare).
8. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

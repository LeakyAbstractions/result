# Where to Get Help

If you're looking for the full Result API documentation, here's the [Result Javadoc](.gitbook/assets/0.5.0).

If you think you've found a bug in the library, please [check the existing issues](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues), and if no one has reported the problem, [open a new issue](https://github.com/leakyabstractions/result/issues/new).

If you have a general question about the library, or how to use it you can [send me a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gcalvo) or [drop me an email](mailto:leakyabstractions@guillermo.dev).

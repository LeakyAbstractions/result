# Lazy Results

There's also a way to encapsulate expensive operations that can be entirely omitted (as an optimization) if there's no actual need to examine the result. To create a _lazy_ result we need to use static method `Results.lazy()`:

```java
    Result<String, Void> expensiveCalculation(AtomicLong timesExecuted) {
        timesExecuted.getAndIncrement();
        return Results.success("HELLO");
    }

    @Test
    void should_not_execute_expensive_action() {
        final AtomicLong timesExecuted = new AtomicLong();
        // Given
        final Result<String, Void> lazy = Results
                .lazy(() -> this.expensiveCalculation(timesExecuted));
        // When
        final Result<Integer, Void> transformed = lazy.mapSuccess(String::length);
        // Then
        assertThat(transformed).isNotNull();
        assertThat(timesExecuted).hasValue(0);
    }
```

Lazy results can be manipulated just like any other result; they will try to defer the invocation of the given supplier as long as possible. For example, when we actually try to determine if the operation succeeded or failed.

```java
    @Test
    void should_execute_expensive_action() {
        final AtomicLong timesExecuted = new AtomicLong();
        // Given
        final Result<String, Void> lazy = Results
                .lazy(() -> this.expensiveCalculation(timesExecuted));
        // When
        final Result<Integer, Void> transformed = lazy.mapSuccess(String::length);
        final boolean success = transformed.isSuccess();
        // Then
        assertThat(success).isTrue();
        assertThat(timesExecuted).hasValue(1);
    }
```
